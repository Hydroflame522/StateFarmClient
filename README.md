State Farm Client is a Hack Userscript for the game Shell Shockers. Based off of Zertalious Aimbot, State Farm Client provides a cleaner, more developed script for your hacking needs. State Farm Client uses similar code compared to Zertalious Aimbot, but our client is more advanced, more easily usable, and keeps in mind the issues with the community. The client is made for experimental purposes only and the responsibility of its usage belongs to the player.

# Installation tutorial:
Before you can install the client, there are a few things you must set up to be able to run userscripts. 

1. Install the proper version of Tampermonkey from https://tampermonkey.net/

2. Make sure you are able to open the extension, and go to the dashboard.

Now you are ready to install StateFarm Client:

3. Go to the releases tab of this github or download the latest client release from the discord server (listed above in this description).

4. Download both scripts, the Client and the Panel, and install them into Tampermonkey.

You are done with installation!

5. Go to https://shellshock.io or one of the shell shockers proxies, and use the client!

6. Our list of proxies can be found as a file in the "others" folder in this github repository. Have fun!
