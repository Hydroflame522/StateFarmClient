State Farm Client is a Hack Userscript for the game Shell Shockers. The client is a skid of Zertalious Aimbot, without ads and with more features, such as the Coordinate Detector, Mod Menu / ClickGUI, and an HP Detect as well as a Panic function.

# Installation tutorial:
Before you can install the client, there are a few things you must set up to be able to run userscripts. 

1. Install the proper version of Tampermonkey from https://tampermonkey.net/

2. Make sure you are able to open the extension, and go to the dashboard.

Now you are ready to install StateFarm Client:

3. Go to the releases tab of this github or download the latest client release from the discord server (listed above in this description).

4. Download both scripts, the Client and the Panel, and install them into Tampermonkey.

You are done with installation!

5. Go to https://shellshock.io or one of the shell shockers proxies, and use the client!

6. Our list of proxies can be found as a file in the "others" folder in this github repository. Have fun!

# ClickGUI
  Not all buttons currently functions due to issues in code implementation but I hope to fix them in the future.
